To calculate Pi values using Gregory-Leibniz Series and Circumference of Sun

Demo Project using React native :-

The purpose of the application is to calculate Pi values using Gregory-Leibniz Series & to find the Circumference of Sun

Liberies used :-

* react
* react-native
* react-navigation
* react-navigation-stack
* react-native-gesture-handler
* react-native-screens

Project handlings :-

* Landing screen with 2 options to move to seperate screens of calculate Pi values & Circumference of Sun

Screen 1: (Calculate Pi values)

-> Based on the "Get values" button press, increaring the "Pi" values with decimal point
-> Displaying "Pi" values in Textview & values will not accept more than "20"
-> Poping up the Alert box, if more than "20" digits in Textview

Screen 2: (Circumference of Sun)

-> To calculate the Circumference of Sun based on assumption "Radius" values
-> "MATH.PI" method is using to find the Circumference of Sun.
